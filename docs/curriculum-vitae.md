## PERSONAL PROFILE STATEMENT

An adept banking professional bridging extensive financial market expertise with evolved technical knowledge. Originating from a strong analytical background in financial markets and risk evaluation, I ventured into the IT sphere, swiftly grasping and applying advanced technical practices. My involvement in the cloud on-boarding for the Prime Services learning perimeter was instrumental, where I learned and applied Kubernetes, Azure, and proprietary private cloud technologies. This initiative allowed me to construct a comprehensive production framework of best practices tailored for cloud environments, alongside developing a toolkit to streamline the global production team's on-boarding process. My career trajectory showcases a robust ability to merge intricate financial concepts with cutting-edge technology, significantly enhancing trading system efficiency and resilience. Recognized for strategic project leadership, I excel in fostering collaborations that drive toward operational excellence and innovation. This success is underpinned by my dedication to problem-solving, teamwork and communication, which ensure that project goals are met with precision and efficiency. My time management and resilience contribute to consistent delivery under pressure, while emotional intelligence and creativity play critical roles in navigating complex stakeholder relationships and fostering an environment of continuous improvement. A commitment to lifelong learning and a nuanced understanding of intercultural dynamics, shaped by my international experiences, underpin my professional ethos.

## WORK EXPERIENCE

### APR-2017 TO PRESENT | SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANKING, LONDON, UNITED-KINGDOM

#### Prime Services & Clearing Reliability Engineer Expert

Upon transitioning from Paris to London, I applied my expertise in production to stabilize operations following the Newedge takeover, achieving an 80% reduction in incidents in the first year and a further 5% annual reduction thereafter. My role evolved through two pivotal stages:

1. **Streamlining Global Production Processes & Enhancing Operational Agility**
    - **`Global Production Practices Foundation`**: Set-up global production standards and best practices and earned stakeholder trust with a 'Follow the Sun' model, by assessing the criticality of key processes (e.g., market/regulatory cut-offs) and developing immediate contingency plans, strategic planning for significant events to maintain operational security, developing a searchable knowledge base for swift incident resolution and reducing key-person dependency, and enhancing agility to foster versatility and multifunctionality.
    - **`Technological and Functional Integration`**: Created comprehensive infrastructure and application interaction diagrams, facilitating a deeper understanding and proactive management of the trading and clearing system’s architecture.

2. **Advancing Cloud Integration & Operational Efficiency**
    - **`Cloud Migration Adaptation`**: Played a pivotal role in the bank's transition to Azure and private clouds by advancing my IaC, GitOps, and Kubernetes skills with a self-led Kubernetes home-lab project. This journey not only refined our production standards but also elevated the team's cloud proficiency, enhancing our capabilities in data monitoring, visualization with Elastic Stacks, and advancing debugging and deployment methodologies.
    - **`DevOps Toolkit & Documentation Enhancement`**: Built a standardized toolkit leveraging open-source technologies, enhanced by Docker for Ansible Playbooks' cross-platform compatibility. Incorporated Cmder to facilitate seamless use of Bash, Python scripts, and aliases on Windows. Focused on cloud management tools (Azure CLI, kubectl, k9s, not an exhaustive list), effectively bridging knowledge gaps and streamlining operations within our team. Advanced documentation practices with Markdown and GitHub, plus a dynamic, interactive knowledge base with GitHub Pages and VitePress, have significantly enhanced productivity.

### NOV 2012 TO APR 2017 | SOCIÉTÉ GÉNÉRALE CORPORATE & INVESTMENT BANKING, PARIS, FRANCE

#### E-Trading Functional Production Engineer

As an E-Trading Functional Production Engineer, I capitalized on my strong foundation in financial markets, acquired through my master's degree, and basic technical skills. This unique combination enabled me to bridge the gap between the specialized IT teams and the dynamic trading environment. My focus on Delta One, Volatility, Hedging, Basket Trading, and Market Making not only deepened my understanding of financial markets but also allowed me to explore the sophisticated information systems at the core of the investment bank's front office operations.

1. **Enhancing Business Operations & Standards**
    - **`System Readiness`**: Conducted daily morning checks to ensure systems were operational before market opens and evening updates for system upgrades.
    - **`Solutions Facilitator`**: Acted as a go-to for technical and functional issues, building strong relationships with traders.
    - **`Decision Support`**: Supported strategic decisions to improve organization, architecture, and market access.
    - **`Tactical Development`**: Developed tactical tools, employing Python, Bash, SQL, and VBA to expedite system readiness and market feed checks during trading phases.

2. **Step-Up as Production Expert**
    - **`Expert Coordination`**: Provided a transversal business view and expertise in trading, arbitrage, and high-frequency tools/IS architecture to the team.
    - **`Talent Coordination`**: Directed talent management, from onboarding and training to coordinating with consultancies for engineering resources.

### APR 2012 TO OCT 2012 | HSBC GLOBAL ASSET MANAGEMENT, PARIS, FRANCE

#### Middle Officer Intern
